### Rules

You've been cursed but the spell was interrupted when it was being casted and left you half cursed. You're now a half werewolf half man during every half moon! You can switch between forms. When your top half is wolf you are stronger and cannot be killed by rocks. You can also bust threw breakable walls! 

Be careful though, you cant open doors to houses with those wereclaws of yours! You're also weak against silver so don't pick up any coins while your top half is werewolf or you will lose 10 points! 

When your bottom half is wolf you can jump higher and move left and right faster. You also gain 10 points from coins! Be care though, you can be killed by flying rocks and you cannot go through breakable walls. Your opposable thumbs can open those pesky cabin doors though!

You need to break the curse, run to the end!
